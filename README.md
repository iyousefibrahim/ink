# Ink

Ink Blog is a modern blogging platform built with **React** and powered by **Supabase** as the backend. I created this project to **practice and apply what I learned in React and Supabase**. The app features a clean and responsive UI, reusable components, optimized state management with **React Query**, and smooth developer experience with **shadcn/ui** and **Tailwind CSS**.

- CRUD blog posts.
- Authentication & user profiles with Supabase.
- View posts with author info, avatars, and timestamps.
- Like, reply, and save posts.
- Full post details page with comments support.

### UI/UX
- Built using **React + shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS**.
- Responsive design with dark mode support.
- Skeleton loaders for smooth content loading.
- Dropdown menus and interactive buttons with **lucide-react** icons.
- Clean and reusable UI components.

### Forms & Validation
- Forms built with **react-hook-form**.
- Schema validation with **Zod** for type-safe forms.

### Data Fetching & State
- **React Query (TanStack)** for server state and caching.
- Supabase as backend (Postgres + Auth).
- Custom hooks for fetching and mutating data.
